### This file shows how to run the code for each task. 

First make sure you are in the right directory of Lab2.

##### Task 1a:
- python main.py -t "1a" 
##### Task 1b:
- python main.py -t "1b" 
##### Task 1c:
- python main.py -t "1c" 
##### Task 2a (with batch norm):
- python main.py -t "2a" 
##### Task 2b (without batch norm):
- python main.py -t "2b" 
##### Task 3a (with dropout):
- python main.py -t "3a" 
##### Task 3b (without dropout):
- python main.py -t "3b" 
##### Task 6:
- python main.py -t "6" 
##### Task 7a (skin):
- python main.py -t "7a" 
##### Task 7b (Bone):
- python main.py -t "7b" 
##### Task 9a (skin):
- python main.py -t "9a" 
##### Task 9b (Bone):
- python main.py -t "9b" 

###Notes:
- For remaining tasks: 
    - Task 4, Server was not running, so we could not test it. However if you want to run it,
     here is the command **python main.py -t "4a"** for skin data, and **python main.py -t "4b"** for bone data.
    - Task 10, there is a problem on eager execution, as soon as we solve it, 
     you can run it using this command **python main.py -t "10"**
